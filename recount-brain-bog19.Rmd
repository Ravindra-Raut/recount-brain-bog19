# Introduction

1. Uniformly-processed RNA-seq is available in `recount2` [@collado2017] and other projects;
2. Sample metadata from SRA is inconsistent, thus re-using this public data is challenging;
3. Metadata can be predicted from expression [@ellis2018] and mapped to ontologies [@bernstein2017].

# Methods

We identified SRA studies present in `recount2` that had at least 4 samples with at least 70% of them were predicted to correspond to the brain using `phenopredict` (v0.0.03) [@ellis2018]. Figure 6 of [@razmara2019] shows the reproducible curation workflow we followed that briefly involved: creating a list of metadata variables of interest, documenting which part of the paper/supplement the information came from, and any custom modifications. We merged `recount-brain` with GTEx and TCGA brain sample metadata and linked to controlled vocabulary terms for Brodmann region, tissue and disease.



# Results

In total, there are 6,547 samples with metadata in `recount-brain` with 5,330 (81.4%) present in recount2 from 62 SRA studies, GTEx (n=1,409) and TCGA (n=707). The curated metadata can be interactively explored through [jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount-brain/](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount-brain/). Figure \@ref(fig:figure1) exemplifies some of the metadata information available for these studies.

```{r figure1, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Overview of some recount-brain sample metadata variables'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/Figure-1.png')
```

## Example usage

Select studies or add the sample metadata to the expression data with `recount::add_metadata()` (Figure \@ref(fig:figure2)).

```{r figure2, out.width='90%', fig.cap='Access recount-brain using the recount Bioconductor package'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/Figure2.png')
```



As an example of how you can use `recount-brain`, we used studies with post mortem interval (PMI) information to assess whether expression of _RNASE2_ is associated with PMI. In studies present in `recount-brain` we did find an overall association as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figure3) in contrast to [@ferreira2018]'s findings. A sensitivity analysis releaved study variability which is why Ferreira et al likely did not observe this association.

```{r figure3, out.width='95%', fig.cap='Replicate findings from other studies using recount-brain'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/Figure3.png')
```

We used `recount-brain` to determine the consistency of gene variability across glioblastoma studies SRP027383 and SRP044668 as well as TCGA (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4)).

```{r figure4, out.width='95%', fig.cap='Assess consistency of gene variability across glioblastoma studies'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/Figure5.png')
```

# Conclusions

1. `recount-brain` [@razmara2019] facilitates human brain RNA-seq analyses.
2. `recount-brain` can be used for reproducing analyses, replicating findings and assessing cross-study variability.
3. Curation efforts are complementary to prediction efforts [@ellis2018] and automatic ontology mapping [@bernstein2017].
4. Our reproducible curation workflow can be adapted to curate more samples and other studies.
